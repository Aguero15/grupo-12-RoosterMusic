## Restrospective:

### What things have worked well.

- Communication among the team through the creation of a whatsapp group. It allows us to be aware of progress as well as possible drawbacks.
- The way of working by organizing the tasks through Jira. By this way it is clear who performs each task and the delivery times.
- Gitflow methodology to manage branches, merge and pull request so that everyone can work on their own functionality.
- Weekly meetings (zoom) "planning" in which the topics of the sprint are seen and the tasks are hierarchized and divided.
- Synergy between team members.
- Good choice of Adobe XD editing software. It allowed us to quickly design the wireframe of the pages as well as to make modifications.

### What needs to be improved.

- Set design limits and reasonable scopes. Functionalities were developed that may have been outside the desired scope.
- Estimating tasks using the Fibonacci series.

### What you have learned.

- Use of Adobe XD design tool.
- Use of git, from the creation of a local and remote repository to the division into work environments.
- Implementation of agile methodology using Jira.
- Readme (markdown) file creation.

### What are the problems that could prevent you from progressing properly.
- Not estimating the right time for each new feature.
- Poor communication in the use of pull requests.
